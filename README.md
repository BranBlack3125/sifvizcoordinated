This page is a ***rough draft*** of the SIFVIZ geovizualization aimed at displaying the Solar Induced Chrlorphyll Fluorescence **(SIF)**. 

Currently, it highlights an interactive map that permits the selection of monitoring sites with higher-vs.-lower SIF values. Additionally, it displays a series of charts conveying monthly and daily SIF values throughout the continental US, either from 2007 - 2017, or frim 2007 - 2010 subsets.

Unsurprisingly, higher SIF responses were recorded most typically in spring months vs. winter. Certain areas of the high plains have consistently higher SIF values than monitoring sites throughout the US.

**Improvements to be made:** ensure objects (charts) do not overwrite each other on monitors of varying sizes (was created on a 17" monitor), find bug preventing time slider from working, pursue greater variety in chart type.
